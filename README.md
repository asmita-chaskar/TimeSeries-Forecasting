# Time Series Analysis Project on Superstore Sales Data

## Overview

Time Series Analysis (TSA) is a critical aspect of data science, focusing on methods to analyze time series data. This project applies TSA techniques to identify patterns and extract meaningful statistics from Superstore sales data. The primary objectives include pattern identification and forecasting future values based on historical data.

## Goals

1. **Identifying Patterns or Features:**
   - Utilize TSA methods to uncover patterns within the Superstore sales data.
   - Extract meaningful insights and features represented by the time series.

2. **Forecasting:**
   - Develop models to predict future sales values based on historical data.
   - Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting models.

## Key Features

- **Dataset:** The project uses Superstore sales data, a non-stationary dataset commonly encountered in retail and business analytics.

- **Techniques:**
  - Various TSA techniques will be demonstrated, including but not limited to:
    - Time series decomposition
    - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling
    - Seasonal decomposition of time series (STL)
    - Prophet forecasting model
